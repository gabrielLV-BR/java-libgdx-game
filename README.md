# Java - LibGDX Game

A game I'm making in Java with the LibGDX framework.

> WARNING! WON'T be a full game, but a collection of tools and systems to aid future projects.

## How to Run

- Download Java for your system;
- Clone repo and open the project with an IDE that recognizes `Gradlew` projects;
- Or run `./gradlew run` (Linux example);
